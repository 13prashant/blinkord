## Solana Actions and Blinks

Blinkord leverages **Solana Actions** and **Blinks** to power its payment and role assignment processes.

- **Solana Actions**: These are customizable and programmable on-chain interactions that enable Blinkord to execute specific tasks, such as processing payments and assigning roles, securely and efficiently.
- **Blinks**: Blinks are shareable, programmable links that allow users to interact with Solana dApps. In Blinkord, they are used to link members directly to specific actions through a common interface, such as paying for and receiving a Discord role.

These tools enable Blinkord to provide a seamless experience for both server owners and members, ensuring fast transactions and secure role management.
